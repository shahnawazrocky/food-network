            <h1>Make an Ice Cream Icebox Cake</h1>
            <h1>Any Way You Like It</h1>
            <p>Here is a potentially hot take from someone whose job it is to tell you exactly how long to roast a
                chicken: I think the
                best recipes are the ones that read like MadLibs. Yes, cooking method guidelines and timing suggestions
                are important,
                but in the ingredient department, nothing beats some wiggle room. Instead of a hard-and-fast list that
                sends me to the
                grocery store, I want an any-fruit galette, emphasis on the any, or a side of grilled vegetables
                featuring whatever I
                already have. Recipes that bend to accommodate my fridge, pantry, and preferences are king, and space to
                riff inevitably
                turns me into a repeat visitor as well—I’ll come back again and again to try a new permutation once I’ve
                got the formula
                down. Sue me: I love to customize! And that is why the Any Way Ice Cream Icebox Cake is my song of the
                summer.</p>
